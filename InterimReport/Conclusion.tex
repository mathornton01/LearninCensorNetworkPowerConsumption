\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Future Work}
After running these simulations there are a number of different ways 
we can go with our future work.  One is to add more complexity to 
the simulation in order to gain deeper insight into how a wireless 
network of sensor nodes reacts to a power consumption attack.  We 
could model the entire network of sensor nodes that the target node 
is connected to so that we can see how the whole network reacts to 
one of the nodes losing power. We can also implement and simulate 
different security protocols to see how they stand up to the attack.  
Since we already have the framework for this type of attack we can 
also research, model, and simulate additional attack methods.
