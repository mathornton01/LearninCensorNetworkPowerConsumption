As the name plainly states, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are not connected by 
wires to anything: including a power supply. These devices often make use of cheaper
disposable and replenishable power supplies such as batteries. The strength of the 
battery used determines how long each of the independent wireless sensor nodes will 
be able to opperate without supply replacement. The nature of these limited power
supplies opens up nodes of WSNs to attacks that drain the limited power supply of 
the node in order to cause the node to halt a selected operating procedure. In this 
paper we simulate a power consumption attack on a node of a WSN in order to help 
devise, and possibly validate certain mitigation strategies for power consumption 
attacks on these nodes.
