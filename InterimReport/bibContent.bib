@article{Bradonjic_Hagberg_Feng_2011, title={Performance of wireless sensor networks under random node failures}, url={http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1050016}, abstractNote={Networks are essential to the function of a modern society and the consequence of damages to a network can be large. Assessing network performance of a damaged network is an important step in network recovery and network design. Connectivity, distance between nodes, and alternative routes are some of the key indicators to network performance. In this paper, random geometric graph (RGG) is used with two types of node failure, uniform failure and localized failure. Since the network performance are multi-facet and assessment can be time constrained, we introduce four measures, which can be computed in polynomial time, to estimate performance of damaged RGG. Simulation experiments are conducted to investigate the deterioration of networks through a period of time. With the empirical results, the performance measures are analyzed and compared to provide understanding of different failure scenarios in a RGG.}, author={Bradonjic, Milan [Los Alamos National Laboratory] and Hagberg, Aric [Los Alamos National Laboratory] and Feng, Pan [Los Alamos National Laboratory]}, year={2011}, month={Jan}}

@book{Harvey_Kyker_2005, title={Development of a photovoltaic power supply for wireless sensor networks.}, url={http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/923150}, DOI={10.2172/923150}, abstractNote={This report examines the design process of a photovoltaic (solar) based power supply for wireless sensor networks. Such a system stores the energy produced by an array of photovoltaic cells in a secondary (rechargeable) battery that in turn provides power to the individual node of the sensor network. The goal of such a power supply is to enable a wireless sensor network to have an autonomous operation on the order of years. Ideally, such a system is as small as possible physically while transferring the maximum amount of available solar energy to the load (the node). Within this report, there is first an overview of current solar and battery technologies, including characteristics of different technologies and their impact on overall system design. Second is a general discussion of modeling, predicting, and analyzing the extended operation of a small photovoltaic power supply and setting design parameters. This is followed by results and conclusions from the testing of a few basic systems. Lastly, some advanced concepts that may be considered in order to optimize future systems will be discussed.}, author={Harvey, Matthew R. and Kyker, Ronald D.}, year={2005}, month={Jun}}
