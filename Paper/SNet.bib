abstract={Wireless platforms are becoming less expensive and more powerful, enabling the promise of widespread use for everything from health monitoring to military sensing. Like other networks, sensor networks are vulnerable to malicious attack. However, the hardware simplicity of these devices makes defense mechanisms designed for traditional networks infeasible. This paper explores the denial-of-sleep attack, in which a sensor node's power supply is targeted. Attacks of this type can reduce the sensor lifetime from years to days and have a devastating impact on a sensor network. This paper classifies sensor network denial-of-sleep attacks in terms of an attacker's knowledge of the medium access control (MAC) layer protocol and ability to bypass authentication and encryption protocols. Attacks from each classification are then modeled to show the impacts on four sensor network MAC protocols, i.e., Sensor MAC (S-MAC), Timeout MAC (T-MAC), Berkeley MAC (B-MAC), and Gateway MAC (G-MAC). Implementations of selected attacks on S-MAC, T-MAC, and B-MAC are described and analyzed in detail to validate their effectiveness and analyze their efficiency. Our analysis shows that the most efficient attack on S-MAC can keep a cluster of nodes awake 100% of the time by an attacker that sleeps 99% of the time. Attacks on T-MAC can keep victims awake 100% of the time while the attacker sleeps 92% of the time. A framework for preventing denial-of-sleep attacks in sensor networks is also introduced. With full protocol knowledge and an ability to penetrate link-layer encryption, all wireless sensor network MAC protocols are susceptible to a full domination attack, which reduces the network lifetime to the minimum possible by maximizing the power consumption of the nodes' radio subsystem. Even without the ability to penetrate encryption, subtle attacks can be launched, which reduce the network lifetime by orders of magnitude. If sensor networks are to meet current expectations, they mu- - st be robust in the face of network attacks to include denial-of-sleep.},

abstract={With the progression of computer networks extending boundaries and joining distant locations, wireless sensor networks (WSN) emerge as the new frontier in developing opportunities to collect and process data from remote locations. Like IEEE 802.3 wired and IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, remote wireless sensor networks are vulnerable to malicious attacks. While wired and infrastructure-based wireless networks have mature intrusion detection systems and sophisticated firewalls to block these attacks, wireless sensor networks have only primitive defenses. WSNs rely on hardware simplicity to make sensor field deployments both affordable and long-lasting without any maintenance support. Energy-constrained sensor networks periodically place nodes to sleep in order to extend the network lifetime. Denying sleep effectively attacks each sensor node's critical energy resources and rapidly drains the network's lifetime. This paper analyzes the energy resource vulnerabilities of wireless sensor networks, models the network lifetimes of leading WSN medium access control (MAC) protocols, and proposes a new MAC protocol which mitigates many of the effects of denial of sleep attacks.},

abstract={Wireless sensor network is a self-configured, infrastructure less wireless network consisting of a large number of sensor nodes equipped with specialized sensors that can monitor various physical attributes such as temperature, pressure, vibration and sound. WSN relies on hardware simplicity to make sensor field deployments both affordable and long lasting without any maintenance support. Security and energy efficiency is the most important concerns in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) design. Sensor nodes are powered up with batteries. Due to unattended nature of deployment, the sensor nodes cannot be recharged again. In this condition, the nodes must optimally consume power. Energy constrained sensor networks periodically place nodes to sleep in order to extend the network lifetime. Various protocols are designed to reduce the energy consumption of sensor nodes by keeping the antenna in sleep mode 90% of time, so that power is saved. MAC protocols are designed to vary the sleep time based on the communication need. However, attackers use their knowledge of their underlying MAC protocol, to reduce the sleep time of the node, so that life time of the node reduces. This problem we refer it as Denial of sleep attack and in this paper we propose effective solution to defend against this attack on a sensor network.},

abstract={The potential for wide-spread use of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in military monitoring, homeland security, and other areas continues to expand. There are, however, security concerns that must be addressed before this potential is realized. One threat to WSNs is the denial-of-sleep attack, a particular type of denial-of-service attack that rapidly drains sensor node batteries by keeping radios active when they should be sleeping to conserve energy. Simple denial-of-sleep attacks involving unauthenticated or replayed packets are difficult to distinguish from bursty data and can force network devices to incorrectly remain in receive mode. This research introduces Clustered Adaptive Rate Limiting, or CARL, a rate limiting approach based on current host-based intrusion detection techniques that is designed to defeat denial-of-sleep attacks. We use simulation to examine tradeoffs and to demonstrate the potential benefits of the CARL mechanism. Providing support for adaptive rate-limiting at the MAC layer, especially in networks that might encounter bursty data, is essential if WSN are to achieve their full potential for mission-critical applications.},

title={Scalable, Cluster-based Anti-replay Protection for Wireless Sensor Networks},

pages={127-134}, 
abstract={Large-scale wireless sensor network (WSN) deployments show great promise for military, homeland security, and many other applications. This promise, however, is offset by important security concerns. The resource constraints that typify wireless sensor devices make traditional security solutions impractical. One threat to secure sensor networks is the replay attack, in which packets are captured and replayed into the network. This type of attack can be perpetrated to confuse observers or to mount a denial-of-service or denial-of-sleep attack. Traditional techniques for anti-replay protection are too resource intensive for large-scale WSN deployments. While techniques for reducing data transmission overhead of WSN-speciflc anti-replay mechanisms have been explored, the important problem of minimizing per-node reply table storage requirements has not been addressed. This paper introduces Clustered Anti-Replay Protection or CARP, which leverages sensor network clustering to place a limit on the amount of memory required to store anti-replay information. We show that clustering keeps the memory required for anti-replay tables manageable, reducing the size from 30% of a Mica2's memory to 4.4% for a 200-node network. While the advantages of this technique are clear, the difficulty lies in securely updating network-wide anti-replay tables when the network reclusters, an event that must happen routinely to distribute energy consumption across the nodes in the network. Our mechanism distributes necessary anti-replay information in a secure, low-overhead, and completely distributed manner. We further show the energy-consumption overhead of adding anti-replay counters to network traffic across several WSN medium access control (MAC) protocols and two representative WSN platforms. On the Mica2 platform, overheads range from a 0% to 1.32% decrease in network lifetime, depending on the MAC protocol. On the Tmote Sky, overheads range from 0% to 4.64%. Providing anti-replay suppor- t in a secure, scalable, and distributed way is necessary to the overall security of future WSN deployments if they are to meet current expectations.},

Wireless Sensor Networks are especially vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks because of their limited processing capability and memory, and because of the broadcast transmission medium. This paper presents the Storm Control Mechanism that aims at mitigating flooding and Denial of Sleep attacks. The system tracks the frequency of the received packets, triggering an alert when it goes beyond a configured limit. The node tries to send the alert to the base station and then it shuts its wireless transceiver for a predefined period of time. The Storm Control Mechanism has been implemented in TinyOS as a security layer integrated in the communication stack, and the implementation has been tested using TOSSIM.},

We demonstrate the Droplet attack's high damage rate to full duty-cycle receivers, and further show that a high frequency version of Droplet can even force nodes running on very low duty-cycle MAC protocols to drop most of their packets.},

abstract={Authenticated broadcast, enabling a base station to send commands and requests to low-powered sensor nodes in an authentic manner, is one of the core challenges for securing wireless sensor networks. μTESLA and its multilevel variants based on delayed exposure of one-way chains are well known valuable broadcast authentication schemes, but concerns still remain for their practical application. To use these schemes on resource-limited sensor nodes, a 64-bit key chain is desirable for efficiency, but care must be taken. We will first show, by both theoretical analysis and rigorous experiments on real sensor nodes, that if μTESLA is implemented in a raw form with 64-bit key chains, some of the future keys can be discovered through time-memory-data-tradeoff techniques. We will then present an extendable broadcast authentication scheme called X-TESLA, as a new member of the TESLA family, to remedy the fact that previous schemes do not consider problems arising from sleep modes, network failures, idle sessions, as well as the time-memory-data tradeoff risk, and to reduce their high cost of countering DoS attacks. In X-TESLA, two levels of chains that have distinct intervals and cross-authenticate each other are used. This allows the short key chains to continue indefinitely and makes new interesting strategies and management methods possible, significantly reducing unnecessary computation and buffer occupation, and leads to efficient solutions to the raised problems.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks have recently been suggested for many surveillance applications such as object monitoring, path protection, or area coverage. Since the sensors themselves are important and critical objects in the network, a natural question is whether they need certain level of protection, so as to resist the attacks targeting on them directly. If this is necessary, then who should provide this protection, and how it can be achieved? We refer to the above problem as self-protection, as we believe the sensors themselves are the best (and often the only) candidate to provide such protection. In this papel; we for the jirst time present a formal study on the selfprotection problem in wireless sensor networks. We show that, if we simply focus on the quality ofjield or object covering, the sensors might not necessarily be self-protected, which in turn makes the system vulnerable. We then investigate dzreerent forms of self-pmtections, and show that the problems are generally NP-complete. We develop eficient approximation algorithms for centrally-controlled sensors. We then extend the algorithms to filly distributed implementation, and introduce a smart sleep-scheduling algorithm that minimize the energy consumption.},

In this paper, the above mentioned aspects of keying are addressed as tierce to optimize communication. First a secure key generation mechanism is presented that aims at optimizing communication. Second, a sleep schedule cognizant protocol is presented to prevent ID spoofing of sleeping nodes. Third, a post attack mechanism is proposed to prevent the compromised nodes to join the network. Our threesome solution not only saves energy by minimizing the communication overhead in establishing keys among sensor nodes but also provides high but secure connectivity for sleep state nodes.},

In the context of ambient intelligent systems, detection of intrusion is even more important. There are numerous sensors, communicating among themselves in an unambiguous manner. Attacks such as sleep deprivation, eavesdropping, etc have become all the more dangerous for heavy dependence on ad-hoc wireless communications. The timeliness of data delivery is of utmost importance in systems like healthcare. Intrusion of any kind may lead to a chaotic condition. The focus of research is now on developing full-proof IDS for the AmI systems. In this article, a study on the transformation of IDS from the primitive wireless ad hoc network to the ambient intelligent scenario has been presented.},

Here, we update the survey of denial-of-service threats with current threats and countermeasures.In particular, we more thoroughly explore the denial-of-sleep attack, which specifically targets the energy-efficient protocols unique to sensor network deployments. We start by exploring such networks' characteristics and then discuss how researchers have adapted general security mechanisms to account for these characteristics.},

pages={1953-1957}, 
abstract={Sleep scheduling algorithms for duty-cycled sensor networks have received great attention, since sensors should dynamically be awake and asleep to save energy consumption. Among all current sleep scheduling algorithms, only the recently proposed energy consumed uniformly-connected k-neighborhood (EC-CKN) algorithm focuses on not only the coverage of the resultant network, but also the network lifetime after sleep scheduling. However, all sleep scheduling processes ignore the fact that potential insider attacks actually can seriously affect or destroy proper sleep scheduling operations and properties. In this paper, we discuss these vulnerabilities and propose corresponding countermeasures for EC-CKN, i.e., secure neighborhood authentication.},

year={2007},

pages={565-574}, 
abstract={Sleep-wake protocols are critical in sensor networks to ensure long-lived operation. However, an open problem is how to develop efficient mechanisms that can be incorporated with sleep-wake protocols to ensure both long-lived operation and a high degree of security. Our contribution in this paper is to address this problem by using local monitoring, a powerful technique for detecting and mitigating control and data attacks in sensor networks. In local monitoring, each node oversees part of the traffic going in and out of its neighbors to determine if the behavior is suspicious, such as, unusually long delay in forwarding a packet. Here, we present a protocol called SLAM to make local monitoring parsimonious in its energy consumption and to integrate it with any extant sleep-wake protocol in the network. The challenge is to enable sleep-wake in a secure manner even in the face of nodes that may be adversarial and not wake up nodes responsible for monitoring its traffic. We prove analytically that the security coverage is not weakened by the protocol. We perform simulations in ns-2 to demonstrate that the performance of local monitoring is practically unchanged while listening energy saving of 30 to 129 times is achieved, depending on the network load.},

year={2011},

pages={1-6}, 
abstract={Radio frequency (RF)jamming is considered as one of the most proficient technique to launch Denial of Service (DoS) attack in wireless networks. Majority of the jamming attacks to-date largely focus on jamming efficiency by transmitting colossal volume of data to obtain better jamming effectiveness. Consequently, as more and more data is transmitted the probability of detecting the presence of a jammer becomes high. In addition the energy expenditure by the jammer is markedly increased. However it is highly preferred to minimize the detection probability as well as the energy consumption for achieving better jamming efficiency during the course of jamming. In this paper we present a novel idea of shot-noise induced RF jamming which demonstrates a fairly good jamming efficiency as well as minimal detection probability. That has been achieved by transmitting very small noise pulses in an efficient way to distort fewer bits of the ongoing transmission rather than disrupting the whole packet. Moreover we also analyze the effect of packet size and data rate on jamming efficiency. Our results divulge a considerable improvement in energy efficiency by lowering data rate with lesser detection probability as compared to the previous work reported in the literature.},

abstract={Sleep deprivation attacks are still an unsolved but critical problem in sensor networks. They aim on quickly exhausting energy reserves of battery powered sensor nodes by continuously sending messages to the node, preventing the attacked node to switch to an energy saving sleep state. Sleep deprivation attacks come also in the form of sending traffic that causes a sleeping node to wake up. Sleep deprivation attacks have the potential to lessen the lifetime of typical sensor nodes from years to days or even hours. One important communication standard for sensor networks is IEEE 802.15.4 that defines cryptographic protection of frames. While many attacks like eavesdropping or modification of frames are covered by the available security mechanisms, these mechanisms do not address sleep deprivation attacks. This paper proposes a secure wake up scheme that activates a sensor node by a secure wake up radio from a sleep state only if messages from an authenticated and legitimate node are pending. A lightweight security verification scheme is used that can easily be performed without requiring the node to change to active state.},
