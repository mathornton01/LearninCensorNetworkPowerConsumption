\begin{abstract}

The work presented in this paper examines two specific forms of power consumption attacks on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). More specifically it attempts to discover possible risk mitigation strategies to use when faced with these types of attacks. The two forms of power consumption that are examined in this paper are the standard denial of sleep attack and a routing power draw attack. It was found that the routing power draw attack compromised sensor nodes much more quickly than did the standard denial of sleep attack. The various types of internal power sources that are used in sensor nodes were also examined. It was found that a Lithium-Ion battery was able to resist denial of sleep attacks for the longest amount of time. We conclude by suggesting that a wireless sensor network employer carefully consider the type of battery they use, as well as the need for routing in their network.
